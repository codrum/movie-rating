This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

I chose to write this week's project with TypeScript in order to keep progressing as a React Developer. So far, the assignments have come pretty easily to me, so I'm challenging myself to write clean & efficient code via TS.

I also chose to style this project with Material UI.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm i
```

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
